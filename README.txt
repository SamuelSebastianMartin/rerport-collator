The Python3 files in this folder are for preparing the report data before the mail-merge. The output is an excel spreadsheet with all the necessary data in it.

For QM students and UMW students there are different programs (can you use *Qm.py for both?)

Not listed on github are:
  * the `.csv` files downloaded from Moodle. These provide the grades, and should be unchanged from their downloaded format.
  * the `csv` files containing the names of students. These should have 3 columns, named Email address,Surname,Forenames. Note that "Email address" must be written exactly (Capital E, no white space). The first row is the column headings, the remaining rows are students.

Note to self: Please leave a copy of last terms .csv files in the folder as an aide m√©moire for the correct filenames - data files must be named correctly.

The Python3 files in this folder are for preparing the report data before the mail-merge. The output is an excel spreadsheet with all the necessary data in it.

For QM students and UMW students there are different programs (can you use *Qm.py for both?)

Please leave a copy of last terms .csv files in the folder as an aide memoire for the correct filenames - data files must be named correctly.
